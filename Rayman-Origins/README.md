# Rayman Origins
This is a proposed autosplitter for the video game "Rayman Origins." The timer removes loads on load screens and splits at the end of levels automatically.

Right now the autosplitter can only be used for any% cagegories because it splits based on the final lum screen and not the time trial.

The splits must be manually started and the final split probably needs to be manual also.
