# Rayman Origins
This is a proposed autosplitter for the video game "Rayman Origins." Right now the autosplitter can only be used for any% cagegories because it splits based on the final lum screen and not the time trial. The timer removes loads on load screens and when restarting a level, both times when the game is loading. The splits must be manually started and the final split probably needs to be manual also.
