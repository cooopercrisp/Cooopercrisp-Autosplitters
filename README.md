# Rayman Legends
This is an updated autosplitter for the video game "Rayman Legends." It has been fixed with the following changes:

The time is no longer primarily tracked with game frames. Instead, the timer runs off real time and pauses during loading screens. This avoids the issue with the frame rate in gameTime being hard-coded at 60.0.

The variable "state" that determined when the timer split has been fixed and renamed to "levelState" for the sake of clarification.
